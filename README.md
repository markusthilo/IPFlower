#IPFlower

...provides a CSV list or HTML/JS network visualisation from network analysis generated by Zeek (conn.log) or iprunner.
Have a look at zeek.org and github.com/markusthilo/iprunner.
The tool is in beta state. It is written in Python 3 for Linux based OS.
Get vis-network and put them into ./javascrip/node_modules/. You might use ./javascript-installer.sh to do that.
For infos about IP addresses put MaxMInd's GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb and GeoLite2-Country.mmdb in a directory ./geolite2/.
Have a look at the config file in ~/.config/ipflower.conf or ./ipflower.conf.
